        <p>On average, two patients per month are admitted to Starship Hospital as the result of a home driveway injury. The injuries
these children sustain are severe. The incidence of this kind of injury has not changed significantly over the past 15
years. A typical scenario involves a 2 year old child reversed over in the domestic driveway by a family member.</p>

    <span class="title">Risk Factors</span>
    
    <p>Although the ages of the children ranged from between 1 and 10 years, very young children are most at risk. The
median age is under two years (23 months). Boys (58%) are more likely to be injured than girls. Children of Maori
and Pacific descent are markedly over-represented in these types of accidents.</p>

		<span class="title">Location</span>
        <p>Most of the children (71%) are injured on their own home driveway. 21% are injured on a relative’s driveway and
8% on a neighbour’s driveway. The majority of the accidents (57%) occur in South Auckland, followed by the West
(6%), Central (14%), North Shore (15%) and NZ Other 7%. Children from less well off families are at greater risk of
injury. Close to 40% of children come from families who fit into the poorest (in socio-economic terms) 10% of the
population.</p>

<p><span class="title">Timing</span></p>
<p>Timing - Most of the accidents (47%) occur in the afternoon between 4pm and 7pm or in the morning between 10am and midday. The
accidents are more likely to occur in Summer, between December and February (39%) than other times of the year.</p>

<span class="title">Driver</span>
<p>The parent of the child is driving the vehicle in over a third of the cases (39%). However, the drivers included relatives
(28.6%), friends and neighbours (18.2%) and commercial drivers (5.2%). Many of the drivers (19) reported seeing
the child in a safe place prior to the accident.</p>
